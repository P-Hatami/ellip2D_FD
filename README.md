# ellip2D_FD
High-performance 2D Elliptic Solver using Sparse Matrix Assembly. This function constructs a global stiffness matrix with spatially-dependent coefficients and enforces Dirichlet boundary conditions through direct matrix injection. Optimized for MATLAB's backslash operator, ensuring rapid and exact linear system solutions.
